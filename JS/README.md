MTurk workers were run in March 2020, while undergraduate students were run through SONA in February and March.

There are two differences in the code for these populations: 1) We have code to automatically extract a MTurk worker's workerID, but we ask SONA students to input their net ID; 2) The php script for data submission informs students that the researcher will grant them credit on SONA ASAP, while MTurk workers just need a confirmation code to input into MTurk.

We counterbalanced across block order. There are two versions because in one, the block order is MC-MC-MIC-MIC and in the other, it's MIC-MIC-MC-MC.

To run the experiment, you would download the task folder, put it somewhere where html is public (published on github? dropbox? or if your university has a personal home directory, as Duke does), and list the Main Menu file as the "Survey Link" on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Note that you would have to fill in the parts of the task that I removed - i.e., where it says "LINK HERE."
