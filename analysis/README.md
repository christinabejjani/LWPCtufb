# Analysis:

* Here, you'll find:
  * the Jupyter notebook that has ALL analyses reported in the manuscript (and all the figures that were generated in the paper are here)
  * The Bayesian inclusion BF notebook are in the separate notebook
  * Correlationstats.py is NOT written by me; as the comments w/in the code itself, it's from https://github.com/psinger/CorrelationStats
